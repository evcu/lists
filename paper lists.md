## Generalization of NN
These include VC dimension (Vapnik, 1998), Rademacher complexity (Bartlett & Mendelson, 2003), and uniform stability (Mukherjee et al., 2002; Bousquet & Elisseeff, 2002; Poggio et al., 2004). Moreover,
There has been muchwork on the representational power of neural networks, starting from universal approximation theorems for multi-layer perceptrons (Cybenko, 1989; Mhaskar, 1993; Delalleau & Bengio, 2011; Mhaskar&Poggio, 2016; Eldan&Shamir, 2016; Telgarsky, 2016; Cohen&Shashua, 2016). All
